## **About me:**

I am currently looking for new opportunities in front-end development. I am open to remote work and a flexible schedule.

I recently completed the "front-end development" course at the "SheCodes" company. I learned a fairly good knowledge base of HTML, CSS, JS and React languages.

Currently, I came to the RS Schools Course «JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0» to improve my knowledge and get a job in the company EPAM.
